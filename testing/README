This directory contains a driver to record and playback/test the
results of a query log to the database.


=======================================================================
   1. Database Initialization
=======================================================================

First, from the root directory of the application, run 

  php testing/test init

This will ask you for a root-privileged mysql user and the
corresponding password, and set up a user to work with the test
database.

=======================================================================
   2. Database Dump
=======================================================================

Then say

  php testing/test dump [-f|-from-time='...'] [-t|-to-time='...']

to create both a new mysql database aixada_dump and the corresponding
dump in testing/dumps+logs/reference_dumps. Default values are
-from-time='-1 months' and -to-time='-1 days'; any time format accepted
by strtotime is fine.

More precisely, the tables in the database specified in the variable
$table_key_pairs in the testing/lib/config.php are written
to the database aixada_dump, along with all entries from other
tables that recursively depend on them via foreign key
constraints. The database aixada_dump is then dumped to the
directory dumps+logs/.

=======================================================================
   3. Choose time interval and apply log file to database
=======================================================================

Next, say

  php testing/test log [dump_file.sql | -f|-from-time='...'] [-t|-to-time='...']

to process the entries in the logfile local_config/aixada.log in a
certain time interval.  

  - If no optional arguments are given, the start time for the log is the
    -to-time for the latest dump file;

  - If a dump file is given, the start time for the log is the -to-time of that dump.

  - The -to-time defaults to 'now'.

The database aixada_dump is dropped and restored from the given dump
file. Then, each entry in the logfile is applied in turn to the
database, and the resulting dump and its hash are stored for future reference.

All timestamps are neutered in these dumps to preserve replayability.


=======================================================================
   4. Test
=======================================================================

The command

  php testing/test test [logfile] [dumpfile]

re-runs the given logfile against the given dump file, and checks that
the results are unchanged with respect to the run that generated the
log file.

The default logfile is the latest available, and the default dump file
the latest one whose ending time matches the starting time of the
given logfile.

If any discrepancy is found in the results, the conflicting entries in
the database are displayed.
